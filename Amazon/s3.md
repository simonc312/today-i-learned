# AWS S3 Storage

store objects (files) in buckets (directories)

## Buckets
- bucket names are globally unique 
- buckets defined at region level
- naming convention
    - no uppercase
    - no underscore
    - 3-63 characters long
    - not an IP
    - start with lowercase letter or number

## Objects

- key is the FULL path to the file
- keys basically very long names that contain slashes "/"
    - a way to partition files
- max size is 5TB for one object
- if uploading more than 5 GB must use "multi-part upload"
- if uploading more than 100 MB "multi-part upload" recommended
- versioning optional
- metadata and tags

- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- [Strong read after write consistency of existing objects since 2020-12](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/) 

No longer needs to overhead use EMRFS for EMR with DynamoDB to checkpoint files to ensure consistency.

[Outdated]
Eventual consistency for GETs, PUTS, LISTs for existing objects
