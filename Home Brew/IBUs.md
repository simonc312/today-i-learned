# IBUs - International Bitterness Unit

IBUs were made to quantify how bitter a beer is. It is a measurement of the number of chemical compounds such as isomerized and oxidized alpha acids and polyphenols. 

Most beers will range between 5 to 120 IBUs with 5 on the very low scale. For example, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has a 38 IBU. Some craft breweries attempt to market incredibly high IBUs for the novelty - recording over 1000+ IBUs. 

Hops and malt are the most common contributers to IBUs. 

Currently, there is a trend for lower bitterness in beers with fruity citrus hops like Galaxy, Citra in IPAs which make the beer taste almost like juice. 

Large manufacturers will rely on maintaining consistent IBUs for their beers as part of quality control.
