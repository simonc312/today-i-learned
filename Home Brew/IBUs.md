# IBUs - International Bitterness Unit

IBUs were made to quantify how bitter a beer is. It is a measurement of the number of chemical compounds such as isomerized and oxidized alpha acids and polyphenols. 

Most beers will range between 5 to 120 IBUs with 5 on the very low scale. For example, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has a 38 IBU. Some craft breweries attempt to market incredibly high IBUs for the novelty - recording over 1000+ IBUs. 

Hops and malt are the most common contributers to IBUs. If whole leaf hops are used instead of the more common commerical pellet hops, the level of bittering compounds decreases over time more quickly. It is why breweries like Russian River prefer to serve Pliny the Younger fresh on draft instead of bottling it for shipping. 

The Alpha resins from hops are not very water soluble, so they require at least 60 minutes of boiling time to extract the bittering compounds.

The hop oils on the other hand are very water soluable and will boil off quickly with steam. So it is recommended to add flavoring and aroma hops separately towards last 15 minutes of the wort boil.

Currently in 2020, there is a trend for lower bitterness in beers with fruity citrus hops like Galaxy, Citra in IPAs which make the beer taste almost like juice. This is achieved through dry hopping during secondary fermentation for 1 -2 weeks instead of boiling hops. 

Large manufacturers will rely on maintaining consistent IBUs for their beers as part of quality control.

### Measurement

Standards were developed by the American Society of Brewing Chemists. 

The beer samples are treated with an organic solvent called isooctane and hydrochloric acid. When the beer is acidified, the bittering compounds separate and attach to isooctane. Centrifuges and shakers help speed up the process, so the isooctane can be extracted and examined by a spectrometer. An absorbance number is measured for compounds that absord 275 nanometer wavelength light only.
